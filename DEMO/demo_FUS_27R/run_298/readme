1. get the data.name file as the initial configuration for lammps
you can: 
  a) unzip the data_name.zip
  b) python3 ../../tools/gro2data_angular_dihedral_huge_rs.py
2. run the simulation
  lmp -in in.llps

Note: 
1. The data file generated by the python script is based on the chain_huge_box.gro file. It is a simple code so might contains some bugs. 
2. The simulation requires lammps with gaussian angular potentials (e.g. 2022-)
3. The tabulated dihedral and CMAP potentials were put in ../../table. Need to modify the in.llps file if the path has been changed.
